We present a novel privacy-preserving pillbox system to help patients improve medication adherence while maintaining privacy and security. Existing smart pillbox systems have been successful in notifying, tracking and reporting medication adherence, but do not provide sufficient security and privacy for the patientsâ€™ medication adherence records. In the proposed system, we protect data that needs to be reported to the doctor by ensuring that the data can only be decrypted by the doctor, authorized by a face-to-face key exchange process through out-of-band communication channels. Our system also gives patients fine-grained control over how their information is transmitted and shared, which has been a major privacy concern for many patients.
