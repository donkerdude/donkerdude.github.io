# Towards AI-based Mental Health Providers

Monitoring the mental well-being of people, especially those who have limited access to medical healthcare providers, is important for improving quality of life. Towards this goal, we have developed multiple systems and platforms to enable people to self-screen and monitor their mental health throughout their daily lives, outside of doctor visits.

Mental status examination (MSE) is an important tool used by mental health providers for assessing mental health. Currently, MSEs are conducted by licensed professionals, which is a barrier for patients in low-income and remote areas. We propose an AI-based Personal Online Mental Status Examination (aiMSE), the first interactive mental status examination platform, where users can self-administer MSEs at home through a web browser, using only a camera and microphone. aiMSE uses multimodal image, speech and natural language processing algorithms to detect signs of abnormalities in mental functioning and recommend them for further examination by a mental health specialist.

There is a growing number of smart devices, sensors, and actuators throughout our environments. In this project, we take advantage of these devices to continuously screen the day-to-day functioning and infer mental wellness of an occupant. Unlike existing "chatbot" works that identify the mental status of users through conversation, our AI therapist additionally leverages smart devices, sensors, and mobile robot systems (e.g., robot vacuum cleaners) throughout the home to infer mental well-being and assesses a userâ€™s daily functioning.
