For many people, the habit of leg shaking is an annoyance to themselves and people around them. By simply becoming aware of the motion, one is able to voluntarily stop shaking. We develop a series of smartphone-based systems and data-driven methods for detecting the irritating behavior of leg shaking. Our systems are robust to the placement of the phone on the user's body and adapts or "personalizes" to the unique leg shaking characteristics of the individual.
