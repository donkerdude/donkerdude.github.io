# Smart Textiles for Continuous Perspiration Sensing

We present a novel wearable sensor system that measures an individualâ€™s sweat level. The system consists of multiple cotton-covered conductive threads that are then braided into one sensor. The braided 3D structure allows robust perspiration level estimation despite the sensor distortion or the motion of the person. This design allows the sensor to be embedded into the seams of clothing, without requiring users to wear circuit boards, smart watches, or other additional wearables.
