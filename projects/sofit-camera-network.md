We present SoFIT, an easily-deployed and privacy-preserving camera network system for occupant tracking. Unlike traditional camera network-based systems, SoFIT does not require a person to calibrate the network or provide real-world references. This enables anyone, including non-professionals, to install SoFIT. Once installed, SoFIT automatically localizes cameras within the network and generates the floor map leveraging movements of people using the space in daily life, before using the floor map and camera locations to track occupants throughout the environment.
