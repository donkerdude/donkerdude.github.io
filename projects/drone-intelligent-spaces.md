Homes are becoming more intelligent due to the growth of smart sensors and devices found in typical homes. However, most of these sensors and devices function independently from one another, limiting the amount of utility and services a truly "smart" home can provide. We introduce two key ideas towards more intelligent homes. First, we explore the usage of mobile drones in the home environment. Second, we propose DIA, a system that seamlessly connects to the home environment and automatically discovers and jointly utilizes smart sensors and actuators around the home to provide services that are otherwise not possible.
