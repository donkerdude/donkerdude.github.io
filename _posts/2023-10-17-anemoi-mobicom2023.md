["Anemoi: A Low-cost Sensorless Indoor Drone System for Automatic Mapping of 3D Airflow Fields"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3570361.3613292) accepted and presented at the ACM 29th Annual International Conference on Mobile Computing and Networking ([MobiCom 2023](https://sigmobile.org/mobicom/2023/)) in Madrid, Spain. Congrats team!

Anemoi is a sub-$100 drone-based system for autonomously mapping 3D airflow fields in indoor environments. Anemoi leverages the effects of airflow on motor control signals to estimate the magnitude and direction of wind at any given point in space.
