["LegoSENSE: An Open and Modular Sensing Platform for Rapidly-Deployable IoT Applications"](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3576842.3582369) was accepted and presented at the 8th ACM/IEEE Conference on Internet of Things Design and Implementation ([IoTDI 2023](https://conferences.computer.org/iotDI/2023/)), co-located with [CPS-IoT Week 2023](https://cps-iot-week2023.cs.utsa.edu/). Congrats team!

LegoSENSE is a low-cost open-source and modular platform that makes it simple for anyone to rapidly set up and deploy a custmoized sensing solution for application specific IoT deployments through ‘plug and play’ and ‘mix and match’.
