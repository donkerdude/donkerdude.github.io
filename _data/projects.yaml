- title: Drone-based Airflow Sensing without Sensors
  image: images/project/Minifly-labelled.png
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We create a drone-based system that senses airflows without directly leveraging any onboard sensors. The platform takes advantage of the drone's motor control system in conjunction with its stabilization mechanism (e.g., PID) and automatically and efficiently explores spaces to map the full airflow field.

  description: We propose recommender systems that optimize the energy consumption, occupant health, and health of building environments by incorporating humans-in-the-loop. Our platforms actuate building resources (e.g., air conditioning) while providing "nudges" to users (co-)optimize these objectives (e.g., move to a different room).

- title: Modular and Reconfigurable Sensing Platforms

  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We create a low-cost stethoscope-based system that leverages augmented reality and artificial intelligence to enable anyone to self-screen themselves, without a health care provider present.
  
- title: Selective and Adaptive Audio Filtering for Mobile, Embedded, and Cyber-Physical Systems
  image: images/project/system_architecture.png
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We introduce a novel acoustic filtering architecture that intelligently integrates the physics of sound waves with a wide range of data-driven models in an adaptive feedback architecture that allows developers and applications to select specific sounds to filter or enhance depending on the application.

- title: Audio Wearables for Urban Safety

  description: We introduce a series of wearable platforms that create a zone of safety around users, leveraging a microphone array to detect, localize, and alert users to oncoming vehicles in a variety of challenging scenarios.
  
- title: Drone-based Systems for Intelligent and Autonomous Homes, Offices, and Spaces
  image: images/project/image-5.png
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We propose systems that leverage drones as a powerful mobile sensing and actuation platform in conjunction with the growing number of sensors and actuators in the built environment to enable a wide range of novel and useful applications.

- title: Self-Orienting Camera Networks for Floor Mapping and Indoor Tracking
  image: images/project/0.Implementation-1024x387.png
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We create an easy-to-deploy and privacy-preserving camera network system that automatically self-localizes and calibrates itself without requiring users to perform any complex setup, beyond placing cameras semi-randomly throughout the environment.

- title: Building Energy Footprinting
  image: images/project/Footprint-1024x331.png
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We develop a system that elucidates each person's contribution (footprint) to the overall energy consumption of buildings. Having this insight can help us identify and reduce sources of heavy power consumption.
  
- title: Robust, Continuous, and Multi-Person Fever Screening
  image: images/project/3DMapping-1024x644.png
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We present low-cost RGB-thermal camera-based systems for automatic continuous fever screening of multiple people, at distance, without requiring users to stop or stand still in front of a reader.
  
- title: Towards AI-based Mental Health Providers
  image: images/project/answering_naming_frozen-1024x501.png
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We present low-cost RGB-thermal camera-based systems for automatic continuous fever screening of multiple people, at distance, without requiring users to stop or stand still in front of a reader.

- title: Smart Textiles for Continuous Perspiration Sensing
  image: images/project/sweat.png
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We develop novel sweat sensors made entirely of conductive threads, allowing them to be embedded into the seams of clothing, without requiring users to wear circuit boards, smart watches, or other additional wearables.

- title: Wearables for Emotion Sensing
  image: images/project/Picture7.png
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We create a low-cost, long-lasting, wireless, glasses-based platform for continuous monitoring of user's facial expressions and emotions in daily life, leveraging only non-contact sensors (e.g., thermal camera and proximity) to reduce discomfort.
  
- title: Smartphone Platforms for Detection and Notification of Leg Shaking
  image: images/project/3d_scatter_oppositeleg_highlighted.png
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We develop a series of smartphone-based systems and methods for detecting the irritating behavior of leg shaking. Our systems are robust to the placement of the phone on the user's body and adapts or "personalizes" to the unique leg shaking characteristics of the individual.
  
- title: Intelligent and Privacy Preserving Pillbox
  image: images/project/pillbox-1024x766.jpg
  link: https://scottz.net/
  description: We create a pillbox with a novel and robust light-based sensing mechanism to detect if patients have taken medication on time. We also ensure the privacy of records through a data transfer protocol that transmits critical data only during face-to-face office visits with health providers.
